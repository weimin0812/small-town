//
//Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowe
//rcase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.
//
// 
//
// Example 1:
// 
//Input:
//s = "aaabb", k = 3
//
//Output:
//3
//
//The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
// 
// 
//
// Example 2:
// 
//Input:
//s = "ababbc", k = 2
//
//Output:
//5
//
//The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeat
//ed 3 times.
